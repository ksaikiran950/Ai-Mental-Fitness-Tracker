# 📊 AI Mental Fitness Tracker

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **AI Mental Fitness Tracker** is a machine learning project designed to analyze and predict mental fitness scores based on various factors. It utilizes multiple regression models to gain insights into mental health trends and provide accurate predictions.

## 📌 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares mental health datasets for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
- **Performance Evaluation:** Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared (R²) score.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides correlation heatmaps, actual vs. predicted plots, feature importance charts, and residual analysis.
- **Scalable & Extendable:** Can be improved with deep learning models and real-time data integration.

## 📂 Dataset
- `mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease.csv`
- `prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder.csv`

These datasets contain mental health and substance use prevalence data, which are used to train the models.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed along with the required libraries.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Mental-Fitness-Tracker.git
cd AI-Mental-Fitness-Tracker
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Mental_Fitness_Tracker_Visualization.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## 📊 Visualizations
The project includes:
- **Heatmap:** To visualize feature correlations.
- **Histograms:** For understanding data distribution.
- **Actual vs. Predicted Plot:** To analyze model accuracy.
- **Residual Plot:** To check error distribution.
- **Feature Importance Chart:** To identify key influencing factors.

## 🏆 Model Performance
The trained models are evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-Squared Score (R²)**
- Comparison of different regression models

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Deploy as a web app using **Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit**.
- Improve accuracy with deep learning models.
- Integrate real-time data for better insights.
